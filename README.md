## Mastermind is a game that consists of deducing a numerical code, or (for example) four or more colors.

### Every time a match is started, the program must "choose" a four-digit number (no repeated digits), which will be the code that the player must guess in the fewest possible attempts. Each attempt consists of a proposal for a possible code that the player types, and a response from the program. The answers will give the player clues so that he can deduce the code.

### The program, then, must generate a number that the player cannot predict. Next, it must ask the user to enter a number with four different digits, and when he enters it, process the proposal and evaluate the number of hits and matches he has according to the chosen code. If it is the original code, the program ends with a congratulatory message. Otherwise, the player is informed of the number of hits and the number of matches, and a new proposal is requested. This process is repeated until the player guesses the code.

## Simple enough, right?

### ok, let's play...

## Clone the repo and... :rocket: :rocket:
